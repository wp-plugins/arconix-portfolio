A powerful, easy and attractive way to display your recent work on your website

== Description ==

= Overview =

Let's face it, if you need to watch a detailed video or read a full-blown user manual in order to use a portfolio plugin, something's gone terribly wrong. A plugin like that should be simple to setup and use and integrate tightly with WordPress providing the smallest learning curve possible to get up and running quickly -- and that's exactly what Arconix Portfolio offers.

Get your basic portfolio up in 5 easy steps:

1. Install and activate this plugin, of course
2. Under the new Portfolio menu item click "Add New"
3. Enter your Portfolio details including uploading an image, assigning features (if desired), and selecting what you want to have happen when the portfolio image is clicked.
4. Create a new Page, place `[portfolio]` into the main editor box and click Publish
5. Sit back and marvel at the awesomeness you've just unleashed upon the internets.

Like all good software there are additional ways to customize the look and behavior of your portfolio. I suggest you take a peek at the [documentation](http://arcnx.co/apwiki) which lays out the various ways you can make your portfolio more personal.

= Features =
* Custom Post Type-driven portfolio showcases your work, keeping it separate from posts, pages and other content types.
* Custom Taxonomy called "Features" allows you to "tag" your portfolio items which creates a filter list for a unique and practical way of presenting that info to your visitors
* jQuery Quicksand for filtering animation (when using the 'features' taxonomy) shows and hides your different portfolio items
* Individually set hyperlinks on portfolio items -- link to the portfolio item's page, a different/larger version of the portfolio image or even link to another web site entirely (perfect for client sites, YouTube or Vimeo videos, etc...). Mix and match to meet your individual needs.
* Supports upgrade-safe CSS changes -- Copy the CSS file from the plugin directory to your theme and the plugin will load your file instead, ensuring no conflicts and no worrying about future updates overwriting customizations.

= Use =

Add the [portfolio] shortcode to your post, page or other content area. Customizations are available and can be access via shortcode options which you can read about in the [plugin documentation](http://arcnx.co/apwiki)

= Also Recommended =

* Display your portfolio items in a rotating slider or multi-image carousel by installing [Arconix Flexslider](http://wordpress.org/plugins/arconix-flexslider) and give your portfolio a boost!
* Showcase the great things people have to say about you or your business by installing [Arconix Testimonials](http://wordpress.org/plugins/arconix-testimonials)

== Installation ==

1. Download and install Arconix Portfolio using the built in WordPress plugin installer, or if you download the plugin manually, make sure the files are uploaded to `/wp-content/plugins/arconix-portfolio/`.
1. Activate Arconix-Portfolio in the "Plugins" admin panel using the "Activate" link.
1. Create your portfolio items from the WordPress admin section
1. Use the shortcode `[portfolio]` on a post, page or widget to display your items

== Upgrade Notice ==

Upgrade normally via your WordPress admin -> Plugins panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display my created portfolio items =

Create a WordPress Page and use the `[portfolio]` shortcode. See the [Documentation](http://arcnx.co/apwiki) for more details and available options

= Where can I find more information on how to use the plugin?  =

* Visit the plugin's [Documentation site](http://arcnx.co/apwiki) for assistance
* Tutorials on advanced plugin usage can be found at [Arconix Computers](http://arconixpc.com/tag/arconix-portfolio)

= The filtering isn't working. What can I do? =

While you can certainly start a thread in the [support forum](http://arcnx.co/aphelp), there are some troubleshooting steps you can take beforehand to help speed up the process.

1. Check to make sure the javascripts are loading correctly. Load the portfolio page in your browser and view your page's source. Look for jQuery, Quicksand and jQuery Easing files there. If you don't see Quicksand or the Easing scripts, then your theme's `footer.php` file is likely missing `<?php wp_footer(); ?>`, which is neccessary for the operation of mine and many other plugins.
2. Check to make sure only one copy of jQuery is being loaded. Many times conflicts arise when themes or plugins load jQuery incorrectly, causing the script to be loaded multiple times in multiple versions. In order to find the offending item, start by disabling your plugins one by one until you find the problem. If you've disabled all your plugins, try switching to a different them, such as twentyten or twentytwelve to see if the problem is with your theme. Once you've found the problem, contact the developer for assistance getting the issue resolved.
